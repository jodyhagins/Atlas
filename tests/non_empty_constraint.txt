# Test: Non-empty vector with forwarded member functions
# Feature: Must contain at least one element, with forwarded functions
# Note: Constraint violations are detected AFTER operations execute (post-condition checking)
#       This is an inherent limitation of generic constraint checking.
#       Operations like pop_back/clear will modify the object before throwing.
