# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

This project is built by and for humans (with a little help from some friendly AI).
Whether human or machine-assisted, we expect all contributions to be made in the
spirit of respect, kindness, and curiosity.


## Our Standards

- Be considerate, respectful, and constructive.
- Critique ideas, not people.
- Assume good intent.


## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, insults, or personal attacks.
- Discrimination of any kind.
- Disruptive or hostile behavior.


## Enforcement

If you see behavior that violates this code, please report it to the maintainers.
We will take any necessary and fair action to maintain a safe and productive environment.


## Summary

Be a decent human being. Thatâ€™s it.

(Sometimes the AI helps out here. If it misbehaves, blame the humans who let it in.)
