# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

This project is built by humans (and occasionally an AI that thinks it's helping). We expect all contributors to be respectful, kind, and curiousâ€”basically, the opposite of YouTube comments.

## Our Standards

**Do:**
- Be considerate and constructive
- Critique ideas, not people (the code is fair game though)
- Assume good intent (we're all just trying to avoid segfaults here)
- Remember that we're all learning, even those of us pretending we know what we're doing

**Don't:**
- Harass, insult, or personally attack anyone
- Discriminate (our bugs don't discriminate, why should we?)
- Be hostile or disruptive (we have compiler errors for that)

## Enforcement

If someone's being a jerk, let the maintainers know. We'll handle it fairly and appropriately, probably while muttering about how we'd rather be debugging.

## The Bottom Line

Be a decent human. It's not that hard. Treat others the way you'd want to be treated during a code review.

*P.S. - If the AI acts up, it's definitely the human's fault. We accept full responsibility for our robot overlords.*
